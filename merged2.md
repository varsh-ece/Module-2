# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the given number into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. declare a variable a ,and get the input from user.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

`````````````````
a=int(input()
print(bin(a))
``````````````````


## Output

## Result
Therefore to write a Python program to convert the given number into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions is
compiled and the output is verified successfully.

# Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Write a python program to define a function named "result" that accepts 2 values and return its sum, subtraction and multiplication.


## ðŸ§  Algorithm
Start

Input two numbers

Read a

Read b

Call the function result(a, b)

Inside the function:
3.1. Calculate sum = a + b
3.2. Calculate sub = a - b
3.3. Calculate mul = a * b
3.4. Return sum, sub, mul

Receive returned values

Assign sum, sub, mul = result(a, b)

Display the results

Print "Sum is <sum>, Sub is <sub>, & Multiply is <mul>"

Stop

## ðŸ§¾ Program

``````````````````````````````````````
def result(a,b):
    sum=a+b
    sub=a-b
    mul=a*b
    return sum,sub,mul
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
sum,sub,mul=result(a,b)
print(f"Sum is {sum},Sub is {sub},&Multiply is {mul}")
``````````````````````````````````````
## Output

## Result
Therefore to Write a python program to define a function named "result" that accepts 2 values and return its sum, subtraction and multiplication
is compiled nd the output is verified successfully.
