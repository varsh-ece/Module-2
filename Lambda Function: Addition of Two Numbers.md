# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Write a function which takes two arguments: a and b and returns the multiplication of them: a*b. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python
## ðŸ§  Algorithm
Start

Input two numbers

Read i

Read j

Define a lambda function

f = lambda a, b : a * b
(This function takes two arguments a and b and returns their product.)

Call the lambda function with inputs

Compute f(i, j)

Store the result (product)

Display the result

Print the product of i and j

Stop
## ðŸ§¾ Program
`````````````````````````````
i=int(input())
j=int(input())

f = lambda a, b: a*b

print(f(i, j))
`````````````````````````````````````

## Output

## Result
therefore to Write a function which takes two arguments: a and b and returns the multiplication of them: a*b. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python
is compiled and the output is verified successfully.
