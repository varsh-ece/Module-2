# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the given number into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. declare a variable a ,and get the input from user.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

`````````````````
a=int(input()
print(bin(a))
``````````````````


## Output
<img width="860" height="260" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aaea421-bb19-4199-80bf-59c6da96186d" />


## Result
Therefore to write a Python program to convert the given number into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions is
compiled and the output is verified successfully.
